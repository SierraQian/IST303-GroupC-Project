<p>
  An economic calendar is a schedule of data releases and news events which relate to the financial markets and the
  economy of the world's leading economies. Economic calendars are typically used by traders and investors to monitor
  market-moving events, such as economic indicators and monetary policy decisions. Market-moving events, which are
  typically announced or released in a report, have the potential to move the markets and, therefore, are closely
  watched by traders and investors.
