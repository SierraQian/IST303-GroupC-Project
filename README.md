# PART A

# App Title: Economic Calendar

# Concept:

A website that shows an economic calendar that updates on a weekly basis. In the background, it would take the most popular time series indicators from the website FRED and show various features of the most popular indicators. Some of the various factors it would list:

1. Day of the week an indicator is going to be published
2. Frequency of the indicator in question (Daily, Weekly, Monthly, Quarterly, Annual)
3. Expected Value (if we can gather that data since that data is not from FRED)
4. Previous Value
5. Change in Value from previous publish
6. Category the series resides in

2. As an admin user, I want to choose the indicators show on the page and the method of calculate the expected value. (frontend: 1 week, backend 1 week)
3. As a trader, I want to have an account to login, and could edit my username and password.
4. As a trader, I want to manipulate and save my own dashboard to see the indicators I am interested in.
5. As a trader, I want to view a list of upcoming economic releases and their expected impact on the market, so I can plan my trading strategies accordingly.
6. As a trader without an account, I want to view the default indicators and upcoming releases.

# Create a burn down chart for monitoring your teamâ€™s progress

Assuming the following estimates for the tasks in Milestone 1.0:

Iteration 1: User Registration, Authentication, and Account Management

- Estimated Effort: 8 days

Iteration 2: Default Indicators, Upcoming releases, and Admin Account

- Estimated Effort: 14 days

Here's a potential burn down chart to monitor the team's progress:
![Picture1](https://github.com/SierraQian/IST303-GroupC-Project/assets/133469784/48341b33-bbfd-47c9-ba22-ceb74488d6c7)

The vertical axis represents the remaining effort in days, while the horizontal axis represents the number of days elapsed. The line indicates the planned effort burn down over time.

As the team completes tasks, the remaining effort decreases. The actual progress is tracked by comparing the remaining effort against the planned effort. Ideally, the actual line should be below the planned line, indicating that the team is ahead of schedule. If the actual line is above the planned line, it suggests the team is behind schedule.

# Include evidence that you are meeting for periodic stand up meetings with your teammates

Based on Agile principles:

1. Schedule regular stand-up meetings: Set a recurring time for your team to meet daily or at a frequency that suits your project's needs. This could be in person, via video conference, or using collaboration tools.

2. Define the purpose and agenda: Start each stand-up meeting by reiterating the purpose, which is to provide brief updates on progress, identify any obstacles, and align on priorities. Keep the meeting focused and time-bound.

3. Share progress updates: Each team member should briefly share what they worked on since the last meeting, what they plan to work on next, and if there are any blockers or challenges.

4. Discuss impediments and provide support: If any team member mentions obstacles or issues, the team can collectively brainstorm solutions or offer assistance to help overcome them.

5. Update the task board or project management tool: Capture the progress made and any changes to the task board or project management tool to reflect the current state of tasks and user stories.

6. Foster open communication: Encourage team members to raise questions, concerns, or dependencies during the stand-up meetings. This promotes collaboration and helps address any issues early on.

The primary purpose of stand-up meetings is to foster transparency, collaboration, and alignment within the team. While I cannot provide evidence of actual stand-up meetings taking place, implementing these practices can help your team stay on track and maintain effective communication.

# Ensure that your development and testing environment is set up. Be sure to have some working functional (however rudimentary) and test code in your repository

General steps:

1. Choose a Version Control System (VCS): GitHub --> https://github.com/SierraQian/IST303-GroupC-Project

2. Set Up Development Environment:

   - Install the necessary software and tools for development, including the programming language, frameworks, libraries, and IDEs or text editors.
   - Configure your development environment to ensure proper integration and compatibility with the chosen technologies.

3. Create Project Structure:

   - Organize your project files and directories based on best practices and the specific requirements of your programming language or framework.
   - Set up the necessary configuration files for your project, such as package.json, pom.xml, or requirements.txt.

4. Write Initial Functional Code:

   - Start by implementing basic functionality to demonstrate the core features of your application.
   - Build a simple working prototype or Minimum Viable Product (MVP) to test the basic functionality.

5. Set Up Testing Environment:

   - Choose a testing framework that aligns with your project requirements and programming language.
   - Install the testing framework and any necessary testing dependencies.
   - Set up test directories and create test files to write test cases for your code.

6. Write Initial Test Code:

   - Begin by writing basic test cases to cover the critical functionality of your application.
   - Use the testing framework to execute the test cases and verify that the code is functioning correctly.

7. Commit and Push:
   - Use the VCS to commit and push your code to the repository, ensuring that your functional and test code is safely stored and version controlled.
