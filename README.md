# PART A

# App Title (TBD) 

# Concept: 
A website that shows an economic calendar that updates on a weekly basis. In the background, it would take the most popular time series indicators from the website FRED and show various features of the most popular indicators. Some of the various factors it would list:  

1. Day of the week an indicator is going to be published  
2. Frequency of the indicator in question (Daily, Weekly, Monthly, Quarterly, Annual)  
3. Expected Value (if we can gather that data since that data is not from FRED)  
4. Previous Value  
5. Change in Value from previous publish  
6. Category the series resides in  

# Project Requirements (expressed as user stories, have the estimated time):
1. As an admin user, I want to have an account to login to the admin system. (frontend: 1 week, backend: 1 week)  
2. As an admin user, I want to choose the indicators show on the page and the method of calculate the expected value. (frontend: 1 week, backend 1 week)  
3. As a trader, I want to have an account to login, and could edit my username and password.  
4. As a trader, I want to manipulate and save my own dashboard to see the indicators I am interested in.  
5. As a trader, I want to view a list of upcoming economic events and their expected impact on the market, so I can plan my trading strategies accordingly. 
6. As a trader without an account, I want to view the default indicators and upcoming events.

<!-- A few more stories to be approved by the team:
7. As a user, I want to be able to filter economic events by country, so that I can focus on the events that are most relevant to me.
8. As a user, I want to receive notifications for important economic events, so that I don't miss out on crucial information and can plan my activities accordingly.
9. As an administrator, I want to be able to add, edit, and remove economic events from the calendar, so that the website stays up-to-date with the latest information.
10. As a user, I want to be able to access historical economic data and view past events, so that I can analyze trends and make informed predictions based on past performance.

# PART B

<!-- We need to answer the following questions by Monday, June 26 at 4:59 PM
1. Decompose your user stories into tasks.
2. Outline what features will be in Milestone 1.0 of your project.
3. Build the iterations (at most 2) that will compose your Milestone 1.0. Record the total days of work and the time it will take for your team to complete that work.
4. Allocate tasks to each team member and record the allocation.
5. Create a burn down chart for monitoring your teamâ€™s progress.
6. Include evidence that you are meeting for periodic stand up meetings with your teammates.
7. Ensure that your development and testing environment is set up. Be sure to have some working functional (however rudimentary) and test code in your repository.
