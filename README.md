# App Title (TBD) 

# Concept: 
A website that shows an economic calendar that updates on a weekly basis. In the background, it would take the most popular time series indicators from the website FRED and show various features of the most popular indicators. Some of the various factors it would list:  

1. Day of the week an indicator is going to be published  
2. Frequency of the indicator in question (Daily, Weekly, Monthly, Quarterly, Annual)  
3. Expected Value (if we can gather that data since that data is not from FRED)  
4. Previous Value  
5. Change in Value from previous publish  
6. Category the series resides in
